# DNG to JPG Converter (GUI)

A simple and user-friendly Python GUI application to convert DNG raw image files to JPG, offering options to resize to specific Megapixel (MPX) dimensions and adjust JPG quality. It also copies all EXIF metadata from the original DNG file to the new JPG.

## Features

  * **Batch Conversion**: Convert multiple `.dng` files from an input folder to `.jpg` files in an output folder.
  * **Selectable Output MPX**: Choose to resize images to common Megapixel dimensions (2M, 4M, 6M, 8M, 10M, 12M, 14M, 16M) or retain the original size.
  * **Adjustable JPG Quality**: Control the output JPG compression quality from 1 to 100 via a slider.
  * **EXIF Metadata Preservation**: All EXIF data from the original DNG file is copied to the converted JPG, maintaining important image information.
  * **Progress Bar**: A real-time progress bar shows the conversion status (Processed/Total files).
  * **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with Tkinter for an intuitive graphical interface.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x is recommended). You'll also need the following Python libraries:

  * `rawpy`: For reading and processing DNG (and other raw) files.
  * `Pillow` (PIL): For image manipulation, resizing, and saving as JPG, and EXIF handling.
  * `tkinter`: Python's standard GUI library (usually comes pre-installed with Python).

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install rawpy Pillow
```

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository (or download the script):**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dng-to-jpg-converter.git
    cd dng-to-jpg-converter
    ```

    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username, or just download the `dng_converter_gui.py` file directly).

2.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python dng_converter_gui.py
    ```

3.  **Using the GUI:**

      * **Input Folder (DNG files)**: Click "Browse" to select the folder containing your `.dng` image files.
      * **Output Folder (JPG files)**: Click "Browse" to choose the destination folder where the converted `.jpg` files will be saved.
      * **Output MPX**: Select your desired output Megapixel resolution from the dropdown menu (e.g., "8 MPX" for 8 million pixels, or "Original" to keep the native resolution).
      * **JPG Quality (1-100)**: Use the slider to set the desired quality for the output JPG images (100 is highest quality, least compression).
      * **Start Conversion**: Click this button to begin the conversion process. The progress bar and status message will update as files are processed.

## Building an Executable (Optional)

You can convert this Python script into a standalone executable (`.exe`) for Windows using **PyInstaller**. This allows users to run the application without having Python installed.

1.  **Install PyInstaller:**

    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the script directory** in your Command Prompt or PowerShell.

3.  **Build the executable:**
    For a single executable file without a console window:

    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed dng_converter_gui.py
    ```

4.  **Find the executable:**
    The generated `.exe` file will be located in the `dist/` folder within your project directory.
